# Lesson-3-CSS-Intro

This is a repository explaining what I learnt from the intro. to CSS part with a small styled website.

1. Backgrounds in CSS: in this part I learnt to add background features like colors, and more.

2. I learnt in this phase any browser Inspector features like ITEM SELECTOR BUTTON (TOP LEFT 1), and DEVICES TOGGLE (TOP LEFT 2).

3. CSS combinations and grouping: In this part I learnt to combine more than one element in one CSS styling part (P, UL, OL, and more).

4. CSS Specificity: In this part I learnt to know which styles comes first at the stylesheet.

DIV = 1
CLASS = 10
ELEMENT = 1
ID= 100

Check for those and add what you find to get what will be applied first.
